    <h1> About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! I’m <strong>Caroline</strong>, an experienced travel consultant currently expanding my career into <strong>Front-End Development</strong> through the <em>ALX Software Engineering Program</em>. With years of experience in the travel and customer service industries, I’ve developed an eye for creating seamless experiences that truly resonate with people.

      I’m passionate about helping businesses especially in travel and service sectors stand out online through engaging, user-friendly, and purpose-driven websites. My mission is to merge creativity with functionality to deliver digital experiences that inspire trust and connection.

    <h2 style="color: #172c66;"> My Current Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to design and build responsive business websites that attract, inform, and convert visitors into loyal clients. I believe in the power of well-crafted websites to boost visibility and create lasting impressions.
    </p>
